AlwaysSmileAmazon
=================

AlwaysSmileAmazon is a Chrome extension that redirects the user to the Amazon Smile page of the product that the user is viewing on Amazon.com. When a user makes a purchase on this page, Amazon.com donates 1% of the purchase price to a charity of the user's choice, without any extra cost to the user.
So the user gets some good karma (without paying an extra cent), the charity gets the money, and Amazon.com gets the user's order. Win-win!

I donate to the `Charity:Water` and encourage you to do the same.
